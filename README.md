# DevExpress .NET MAUI Controls - Localization Resources

This repository contains localization resource files with UI strings translated into the following languages:

### DevExpress localizations

* [English (default language)](DevExpressMaui.resx)
* [German](DevExpressMaui.de.resx)
* [French](DevExpressMaui.fr.resx)

### Community localizations

* [Portuguese](DevExpressMaui.pt.resx)

## Create a Language Resource

Follow the steps below to localize DevExpress .NET MAUI Controls to a specific language:

1. Create a new resource file and name it `DevExpress.Maui.<culture_name>.resx`. The `<culture_name>` should match language (based on the [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) standard). For example, `DevExpress.Maui.it.resx` will be applied to your application when device language is set to **Italian**.
1. Add the newly created resource to your application.
1. Make certain that the `.UseDevExpress` method parameter is set to `true`. Refer to the [Localization help topic](https://docs.devexpress.com/MAUI/404120/localization?v=22.2) to learn more on the localization process.
1. **Optional**. If you want to share your translation with the community, fork this repository, add your resource file with the translated localization strings, and create a pull request for this repository.
